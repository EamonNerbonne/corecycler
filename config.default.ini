# The program to perform the actual stress test
# The following programs are available:
# PRIME95
# AIDA64
# YCRUNCHER
# Note: For AIDA64, you need to manually download and extract the portable ENGINEER version and put it
#       in the /test_programs/aida64/ folder
# Note: AIDA64 is somewhat sketchy as well
# Default: PRIME95

# The test modes for Prime95
# --------------------------
# SSE:    lightest load on the processor, lowest temperatures, highest boost clock
# AVX:    medium load on the processor, medium temperatures, medium boost clock
# AVX2:   heavy load on the processor, highest temperatures, lowest boost clock
# CUSTOM: you can define your own settings for Prime. See the "customs" section further below
# Default: SSE
modePrime = SSE


# The FFT size preset to test (Prime95 only setting)
# These are basically the presets as present in Prime95
# Note: If "mode" is set to "CUSTOM", this setting will be ignored
# Smallest:  Smallest FFT: 4K to 21K     - tests L1/L2 caches, high power/heat/CPU stress
# Small:     Small FFT:    36K to 248K   - tests L1/L2/L3 caches, maximum power/heat/CPU stress
# Large:     Large FFT:    426K to 8192K - stresses memory controller and RAM (although memory testing is disabled here by default!)
# Huge:      New custom mode: anything above 8192K
# All:       All FFT:      4K to whatever is the highest FFT (32768K for SSE/AVX, 51200 for AVX2)
# Default: Huge
FFTSize = Huge


# The test modes for Aida64
# -------------------------
# CACHE: Starts Aida64 with the "Cache" stress test
# RAM:   Starts Aida64 with the "Memory" stress test
# Default: CACHE

# from the default value to something higher.

# The "Large"/SSE preset has even more - 55 entries, so possibly an even longer time for a complete pass through all of
# them.
# If this setting is disabled, there's a relatively high chance that each core will eventually pass through all of the
# FFT sizes since Prime95 doesn't stop between the cores and so it evens out after time.
