# The program to perform the actual stress test
# The following programs are available: PRIME95, AIDA64
# Note: For AIDA64, you need to manually download and extract the portable ENGINEER version and put it
#       in the /test_programs/aida64/ folder
# Default: PRIME95

# The mode of the stress test
# Prime95 settings:
# SSE:    lightest load on the processor, lowest temperatures, highest boost clock
# AVX:    medium load on the processor, medium temperatures, medium boost clock
# AVX2:   heavy load on the processor, highest temperatures, lowest boost clock
# CUSTOM: you can define your own settings for Prime. See the "customs" section further below
# Aida64 settings:
# CACHE: Starts Aida64 with the "Cache" stress test
# RAM:   Starts Aida64 with the "Memory" stress test
#
# Default: SSE (for Prime95) resp. CACHE (for Aida64)

# The FFT size preset to test (Prime95 only setting)
# These are basically the presets as present in Prime95
# Note: If "mode" is set to "CUSTOM", this setting will be ignored
# Smallest:  Smallest FFT: 4K to 21K     - tests L1/L2 caches, high power/heat/CPU stress
# Small:     Small FFT:    36K to 248K   - tests L1/L2/L3 caches, maximum power/heat/CPU stress
# Large:     Large FFT:    426K to 8192K - stresses memory controller and RAM (although memory testing is disabled here by default!)
# Huge:      New custom mode: anything above 8192K
# All:       All FFT:      4K to whatever is the highest FFT (32768K for SSE/AVX, 51200 for AVX2)
# Default: Huge
